Search & get results


todo: 
- search functionality - display results
    - display name, cover, date, language, and author?
    - merge search result data only if metadata is scanned

- global search API
    - input search request
- global download API
    - input download request
    - clear items from queue
- global get metadata API + database

localhost server? => sockets


how to pause / resume?
- pause order of adding I guess, ie don't add all images at once

don't have manager at all 
- have global queue, add when needed
- ie only add a few things to the queue at once for the extension, rest are in another pseudoqeuee?
    or have a real queue that's processed externally anyways so it doesn't really matter
        real queue is hidden from extension timeout and stuff in metadata
        real queue resolves search requests n' shit (ie get images for chapter)


priority queue:
- nullify download param and search param, when reached will abandon since cannot peek
    - sohuld be 
       - access page API
       - download page image
